[Data orchestration](https://pipeline.zoominfo.com/operations/what-is-data-orchestration-the-modern-approach-to-business-intelligence) is the practice of acquiring, cleaning, matching, enriching, and making data accessible across technology systems. Effective data orchestration captures data from several sources and unifies it within a centralized system, making it organized and ready for use by revenue professionals.

## **What are the Steps Involved in Data Orchestration?**

Maintaining actionable data is a symbiotic process with several steps: 

### **Cleansing**

Increasing the number of usable records in your database depends on starting with a clean data set. Clean data means it’s formatted correctly, complete, and up to date. This step resolves inconsistencies using [normalization tools](https://pipeline.zoominfo.com/marketing/what-is-data-normalization).

### **Deduping**

Prevents duplicate data from disrupting sales and marketing teams. Whether it’s data uploaded from trade shows, list buys, or webinar leads, record merging and duplicate prevention logic form an important part of the orchestration process. 

### **Standardizing**

Also referred to as normalizing, data standardization uses rules, templates and field mapping to refine data into [standard taxonomies](https://pipeline.zoominfo.com/marketing/what-is-data-normalization). This ensures that the formatting of any incoming data complies with your systems. For example, you can run a workflow to standardize phone numbers in batches to ensure auto-dialers return a higher contact rate. Standardization makes lead routing more efficient, resulting in fewer lost opportunities. 

### **Matching**

Matching is the process of pairing records together to ensure that fields map correctly. When you match inbound leads to accounts, you make a scalable [account-based marketing (ABM) strategy](https://pipeline.zoominfo.com/marketing/data-account-based-marketing) possible. By showing lead data in the context of a prospect’s overall account, you reveal key information like customer history, account assignments, and [territory planning](https://pipeline.zoominfo.com/sales/sales-territory-plan "How to Build a Sales Territory Plan with a Buyer-Centric Approach").

### **Enriching**

Multi-vendor, [real-time enrichment](https://www.zoominfo.com/features/data-enrichment) triggers give teams additional information on prospects. As you import a list, any critical data points that are missing (like phone number, region, or job title) can be populated automatically. The enrichment process  of data orchestration results in better lead-to-account matching. 

### **Segmenting**

Segmentation tools increase the ability to execute multi-channel go-to-market strategies by categorizing and filtering data into clear [buyer personas](https://pipeline.zoominfo.com/marketing/marketing-buyer-personas "customer personas"), sales territories, scores, job role, industry classification. This empowers teams with precision targeting capabilities to identify new opportunities and run hyper-targeted campaigns.

### **Routing**

Once your data is cleaned, deduped, enriched, and segmented it has to be sent somewhere. How effectively it’s routed to the correct people or queues depends on orchestrating the right routing rules. For example, leads for specific industries can be automatically sent to the reps that specialize in their needs. Or if an enterprise-level account comes in, it can be sent to the best rep to handle a customer of that size. 

### **Prevention**

Data orchestration prevents future data inaccuracies from entering the system by using customizable workflows to automatically identify and resolve duplicates, [normalize incoming data](https://pipeline.zoominfo.com/operations/what-is-data-normalization "What is Data Normalization & Why Should You Care?"), and enrich fields with specific sources.
