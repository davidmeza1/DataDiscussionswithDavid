[Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) is an open-source vector database. It allows you to store data objects and vector embeddings from your favorite ML-models, and scale seamlessly into billions of data objects.


[Streamlit-Weaviate Connection](https://github.com/weaviate/st-weaviate-connection/tree/main)
This project is a submission for the [Streamlit Connections Hackathon 2023](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/connections-hackathon/47574). It delivers a Streamlit connector for the open-source vector database, [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/).

Example:

[Magic Chat](https://weaviate-magic-chat.streamlit.app/)
Magic Chat is a chatbot built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) to search for [Magic the Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) cards. It offers multiple search options such as traditional BM25, Semantic, Hybrid, and Generative Search to find cards for your dream deck. Whether you're looking for blue cards to nullify spells, black cards to create an undead army, or just want to find new cool cards! Our Weaviate database contains 27k cards from the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/) ready for you to be discovered.

[Health Search demo](https://github.com/weaviate/healthsearch-demo)
Welcome to the Healthsearch Demo, an open-source project aimed at showcasing the potential of leveraging user-written reviews and queries to retrieve supplement products based on specific health effects.

### [Deep Dive: How do Vector Databases Work](https://newsletter.theaiedge.io/p/deep-dive-how-do-vector-databases?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)
Today we dive into the subject of vector databases. Those databases are often use in search engines by using the vector representations of the items we are trying to search. We dig into the different algorithms that allow us to search for vectors among billions or trillions of documents.**_
