[Getting started with Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph)
Memgraph is an open source graph database built for teams who expect highly performant, advanced analytical insights - as compatible with your current infrastructure as Neo4j (but up to 120x faster). Memgraph is powered by an in-memory graph database built to handle real-time use cases at enterprise scale. Memgraph supports strongly-consistent ACID transactions and uses the standardized Cypher query language for structuring, manipulating, and exploring data.

[Implement a custom query module in Python](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/tutorials/implement-custom-query-module-in-python)
This tutorial will give you a basic idea of how to develop a custom query module in Python with Memgraph Lab 2.0 and use it on a dataset.
In short, query modules allow you to expand the Cypher query module with various procedures. Procedures can be written in Python or C languages. Our MAGE library has various modules dealing with complex graph algorithms, but you can implement your own procedures gathered in query modules to optimize your queries. If you need more information about what query modules are, please read our [reference guide on query modules](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/reference-guide/query-modules).
