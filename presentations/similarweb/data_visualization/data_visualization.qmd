## Data Visualization

Data visualization is **the communication of data and information using charts, graphs, diagrams, and other infographics**. Visuals make data and text easier to digest by taking different learning styles and approaches into consideration and helping to convey content as efficiently and effectively as possible.

## Why is Data Visualization Important

**The following is a quotation from Hal Varian, Google's chief economist**

The ability to take data---to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it---that's going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades.

Why is it important..........

## Data Literacy

Your organization should have an understanding of Data Literacy from the top down.

**Data literacy is the ability to read, work with, analyze and communicate with data.**

Viewed through the lens of the 4 levels of Analytics

![](images/paste-2BDD49F3.png){fig-align="center"}

## Descriptive: the what (explore)

Descriptive statistics turn the data into something more understandable than raw data but data visualization goes further than that and **creates a visual which quickly tells a story**.

![](images/paste-401C4C77.png){fig-align="center"}

## Diagnostic: the why (explain)

Diagnostic analytics is **a form of advanced analytics that examines data or content to answer the question, "Why did it happen?"** It is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining and correlations

![](images/paste-F1ACCDB2.png){fig-align="center"}

## Predictive: what + why = prediction (time frame)

Predictive analytics is ***the use of statistics and modeling techniques to determine future performance based on current and historical data***

![](images/paste-2E72D09E.png){fig-align="center"}

## Prescriptive: data driven decisions

Prescriptive analytics is **the process of using data to determine an optimal course of action**. By considering all relevant factors, this type of analysis yields recommendations for next steps.

## The Four C's of Data Visualization

::: panel-tabset
## Curiosity

We can break down overall visualization, filter it, start to get answers and generate more questions.

-   What is causing my KPI to fall?

-   Why is my churn so high?

-   How can I improve engagement?

## Creativity

The ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships and to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, interpretations, and originality.

Get insight from diverse groups.

## Critical Thinking

Disciplined thinking that is clear, rational, open-minded, and informed by evidence.

-   Observe

-   Gather input

-   Strategize

## Communication

We mentioned above, data visualization is communication. Communication is the act of transferring information from one place, person or group to another.

But it is also about **story telling** with data ........... plan it out

## Framework For Data Visualization

::: r-fit-text
1.  Understand your domain.
2.  Ask good questions. Ask plenty of questions. Can you ask the right question tied to the right business objective.
3.  Acquire the data. Understand your data pipeline so you can repeat and reproduce results.
4.  Analyze. You do not need to be a data scientist, just be data literate.
5.  Apply your personal experience and domain knowledge.
6.  Review output with a diverse group.
7.  Make a decision, publish, promote and communicate it.
8.  Provide instructions and demos on how to interpret views.
9.  Have a feedback loop.
10. Celebrate
11. Do it again

## A Cool NASA Fact you may not know

The Curiosity rover's wheels leave tracks that spell out "JPL" in Morse code as a tribute to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
